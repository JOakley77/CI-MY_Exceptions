#MY_Exceptions.php

###Overview
I was bored and needed a project. This was born (re-invented) for the gazillionth time.

###Description
More verbose exception handling in Codeigniter.

###FYI
This is by no means perfect. I wanted more of a boilerplate exception handling class to use in my projects without having to import multiple files. Everything is encapsulated within this class (presentation and all). Feel free to rip that out and pull in whatever presentation logic/assets you want.
